# Meaning of “Warung Soal”
The term warung
 refers to a small local shop or stall in Indonesian culture, a place where people gather not only to buy items but also to meet, chat, and share knowledge. Meanwhile, soal
 means questions or problems, usually in the context of education or exercises.

So, “Warung Soal” can be translated as “Question Stall” or “Problem Hub”, symbolizing a friendly and accessible place where students can come together to exchange, solve, and discuss problems.

Vision for USYD Online Learning Hub
Through Warung Soal, our hope is to create a collaborative online learning hub for University of Sydney students, especially those in the Fellowship program. We want this platform to be:

- A peer-to-peer help center where students can support each other.

- A resource-sharing environment to reduce barriers in accessing learning materials.

- A space to practice problem-solving and critical thinking together, much like gathering at a warung in real life.

# Motivation and Challenges
We chose to use the term warung
 because it reflects inclusivity, warmth, and the grassroots nature of learning—something informal yet powerful. Our challenge was to bridge cultural terms into academic ecosystems. While warung
 might not have a direct English equivalent, its essence captures the community-driven spirit that we want this project to represent.

# The main problems we’re tackling:

- Students often feel isolated in digital platforms and need a cultural-based entry point.

- Existing tools feel formal or transactional, while learning is often social and contextual.

- By borrowing from local Indonesian concepts, we combine cultural familiarity with global accessibility.

In short, Warung Soal is not just about practicing questions; it’s about building a supportive academic community where every student belongs.
